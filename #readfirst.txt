1. You must obviously have sidebery installed, import [ sidebery-data-soulhotel.json ]
This only imports settings, style, context menu, wont override screenshot history, etc
if you dont want to import, place text from [ sb-style-edit.txt ] in your sidebery style editor console

2. Insure you have userchrome toggled on in about:config, you should understand this part

3. open your customize toolbar window
do this [ https://imgur.com/a/qb52odZ ] [ #openwithreadfirst.jpg ]
im using this transparent dark space theme [ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-space-full-transparent/ ]

4. sidebery extension goes to the far left
5. url bar right next to it
6. ublock origin or reload button goes right next to url bar
7. flexible spaces
8. drag your (bookmarks toolbar items) OUT of the bookmark toolbar and place it next to the flexible space
9. flexible spaces ^
10. back, reload, fwd buttons, other buttons
11. right click bookmark tool bar (never show) once done
12. disable and empty your overflow menu
[ 13. ] get the extensions for minmaxclose buttons and place them to the far right
[ 13b. ] [ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/18029308/) ]
[ 13c. ] [ https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/close-minimize-and-maximize/ ]
this ^ one is a bit more minimal, allows you more space
[ 13d. ] I went ahead and customized the icon for 13c. already, all icons [ chrome/chrome/iconxtra.css ]

with the help of
